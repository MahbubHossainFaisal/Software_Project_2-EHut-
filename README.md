Advance e-commerce

Description :
We want to build an e-commerce website.

Background: Mainly in Dhaka city where people are doing their job and can’t find enough time to go to the grocery store every week to buy their groceries. Who goes shopping most of the time goes without a proper shopping list and spends more than their need. That’s why we are offering a smart web service that can suggest them make a proper shopping list based on 3 parameters.

i. number of a family member

ii. monthly budget

iii. based on previous shopping stats

Customers can always edit the suggestion based on their needs. Then customers can order those products online. We will deliver products weekly. The best part is customers can make payments monthly and they can choose a specific time limit on a specific day of the week when s/he wants the delivery (e.g. 7 pm-9 pm, Monday). This way customers can save time and save themselves from overspending.
